# VC Outreach Workflow Agent

## Description
The VC Outreach Workflow Agent is a powerful AI-powered assistant designed to streamline the fundraising process for startups by automating VC outreach communications. It helps founders connect with potential investors more efficiently by handling the time-consuming process of crafting personalized outreach messages, generating warm introductions, and creating professional cold emails.

## Purpose
Fundraising is one of the most challenging aspects of building a startup. Founders spend countless hours researching potential investors, finding contact information, and crafting personalized messages. This agent automates these processes, allowing founders to focus on what matters most - building their product and business.

## Functionalities

The agent provides an end-to-end workflow for VC outreach:

1. **Email Discovery**: Automatically finds the email address of a VC partner based on their name, fund, and online presence.

2. **Warm Introduction Generation**: Creates a personalized introduction message that a mutual connection can send to a VC partner, leveraging existing relationships to increase response rates.

3. **Cold Email Drafting**: Crafts professional, personalized cold emails that highlight your startup's unique value proposition and alignment with the VC's investment thesis.

## Technical Implementation

This agent is built using:
- **LangGraph**: For orchestration of the multi-step workflow
- **uAgents/Fetch.ai**: For agent communication and deployment on the Fetch.ai network
- **LLM-powered agents**: For email discovery, intro generation, and email drafting

The workflow is designed as a directed graph with each node handling a specific task in the outreach process.
